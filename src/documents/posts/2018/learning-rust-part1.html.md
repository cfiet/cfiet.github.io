Guess who's back?


I have recently found myself spending more and more of my spare time
learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which I find a very 
unique and interesting experience. I feel it's an amazing opportunity to 
re-start this blog and share some of my thoughts, hopefully learning on 
the way and showing some of the cool stuff I'm making.


So stay tuned, tomorrow I'm planning to share quite a long write-up
on why, out of all the languages out there, I've decided to spend
my time on Rust.
